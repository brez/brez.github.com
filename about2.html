SUPERIOR READY MIX (SRM) <br/> // 1201 / DANGER-S / XMEGA //  unofficially formed over the span of a few years and countless house parties as a TABLIST / DRUMNBASS crew specializing in its unique form of renegade skratch precision unmatched by its rivals. SRM soon achieved lasting peace with such legendary underground crews as DRUMZ, DEEP, 45PSI, DRAGON LOUNGE, BULLETPROOF, RUFFNECK ALLIANCE, EVOLVE, LARGEHUMAN, PROPECHY to produce events of their own from local one-offs and weekly/monthly events to the first ever FM DRUMNBASS radio program in Southern California -> 'EKG' showcased local and nationwide DJs/Producers and ran every saturday night for 17 months, on the now defunct, 92/1FM under the direction of the legendary <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/feature/524/halloran.html">Mike Halloran</a>. 
          </p>
          <p>
Weary from a 16-show run producing the backroom at the RAPTURE [45PSI], SRM chose to pull its ground troops from the fray, shutting down the bulk of it forward operating bases in lieu of various endevours. Occasionally coming out of retirement, SRM continues to throw one off parties and remains active producing records out of its various bunkers from New York City to California.

This archive represents the entirety of what SRM produced starting in 1999 unto the present day conveniently listed in the <a href="music.html">MUSIC</a> section. <br/>RESPECT to ALL worthy of their IMPERIAL GRACE.
